In which I am tackle a dataset of healthcare domain.
then I am perform some EDA techniques to analyse the various attribute of this dataset.
the EDA and its Technique i am using these are:
--Exploratory data analysis
      - [Check shape of the dataset](#6.1)
	    - [Preview the dataset](#6.2)
	    - [Summary of dataset](#6.3)
      - [Dataset description](#6.4)
      - [Check data types of columns](#6.5)
      - [Important points about dataset](#6.6)
      - [Statistical properties of dataset](#6.7)
      - [View column names](#6.8)

------ EDA Techniques ------
  
1.   Univariate analysis
      - [Analysis of `target` feature variable](#7.1)
      - [Findings of univariate analysis](#7.2)
2.	Bivariate analysis
      - [Estimate correlation coefficients]
      - [Analysis of `target` and `cp` variable]
      - [Analysis of `target` and `thalach` variable]
      - [Findings of bivariate analysis]
3.	Multivariate analysis
      - [Heat Map].
      - [Pair Plot].
4.	Dealing with missing values
      - [Pandas isnull() and notnull() functions]
      - [Useful commands to detect missing values]
      -	[Check with ASSERT statement]
5.	Outlier detection
      - [Boxplot function]

---- Conclusion ----
  	  -So by using all these i am analyse the datset and analyse  a some meaningful information which is very helpful in the field of medical science.
