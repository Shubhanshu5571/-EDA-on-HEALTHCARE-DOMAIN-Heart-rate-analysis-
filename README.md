In this project, I explore a healthcare dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The techniques I used include univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. I also dealt with missing values and outlier detection. The insights I gained from this analysis can be helpful in the field of medical science.
