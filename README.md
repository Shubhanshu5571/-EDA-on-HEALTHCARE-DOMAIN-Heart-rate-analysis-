-In which I am tackle a dataset of healthcare domain.
-Then I am perform some EDA techniques to analyse the various attribute of this dataset.
-The EDA and its Technique i am using these are:
--Exploratory data analysis
      - [Check shape of the dataset]
      - [Preview the dataset]
      - [Summary of dataset]
      - [Dataset description]
      - [Check data types of columns]
      - [Important points about dataset]
      - [Statistical properties of dataset]
      - [View column name]

------ EDA Techniques ------
  
1.   Univariate analysis
      - [Analysis of `target` feature variable]
      - [Findings of univariate analysis]
2.	Bivariate analysis
      - [Estimate correlation coefficients]
      - [Analysis of `target` and `cp` variable]
      - [Analysis of `target` and `thalach` variable]
      - [Findings of bivariate analysis]
3.	Multivariate analysis
      - [Heat Map].
      - [Pair Plot].
4.	Dealing with missing values
      - [Pandas isnull() and notnull() functions]
      - [Useful commands to detect missing values]
      -	[Check with ASSERT statement]
5.	Outlier detection
      - [Boxplot function]

---- Conclusion ----
-So by using all these i am analyse the datset and analyse  a some meaningful information which is very helpful in the field of medical science.
